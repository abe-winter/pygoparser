## pygoparser

(py2.7 only)

Simple lexer & statement detector for golang source.

Not ultra useful. Golang's built-in AST & transformation tools are full-featured and fine (a lesson I learned after writing this). If, however, you have a python project that needs to index golang files and you don't want to call out to a go program, this may be for you.

See `goparser/test.py` for examples.
